# Contributing:
We are glad that you are interested in contributing to our project! Contributions here are made through forking the repository and submitting pull requests. This document will guide you through the process.

There are two sections:
1. Use this section when working with the command line
2. Working with the command line (recommended for the future)

pls note that while creating new branches is optional it is recommended when many people are working on the same thing. You don't have to necessarily create branches though <br>
also please don't make a pull request after each commit. make commits first!
